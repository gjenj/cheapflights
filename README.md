## CheapFlights
A personal project to aggregate flight searches from multipe travel websites such as Kayak, Kiwi, FlightHub, etc.

## Motivation
I'm an avid traveller. In the Fall of 2016 I was planning an across-the-globe trip spanning Europe, India, Japan, and Hong Kong; I'd depart over the Atlantic and return over the Pacific. While planning, I discovered that the results for airfare (especially multi-city airfare) varied from site to site. I searched for days, and I was able to knock off over $400 off of my initial searches by buying tickets from three differest websites. Beaming with pride over my greatest accomplishment since making an edible meal, I often gloated to my friends and family how I'm the master of finding the cheapest flights one could find. My smugness cost me my reputation as a meek and humble individual. However, the more I bragged, the more that got me thinking - did I really find the cheapest flight one could possibly find? How can I guaranteed that it is the cheapest? What if I had searched for a few more days? 

## Goal
Different travel websites use different methods for cost and route optimization, however my question is that if everyone is truly optimized, how was I able to find a cheaper route?

This project isn't necessarily intended to turn into an app or package, it's to practice Python, Hadoop, and Spark while solving a problem I love to tackle for myself and my friends - finding cheap airfare. If the solution turns into something bigger, all the better!

## Solution

<!---
At the top of the file there should be a short introduction and/ or overview that explains **what** the project is. This description should match descriptions added for package managers (Gemspec, package.json, etc.)

## Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Motivation

A short description of the motivation behind the creation and maintenance of the project. This should explain **why** the project exists.

## Installation

Provide code examples and explanations of how to get the project.

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

## Contributors

Let people know how they can dive into the project, include important links to things like issue trackers, irc, twitter accounts if applicable.
